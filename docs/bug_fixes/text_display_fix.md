# Bug Fix: Text Not Displayed in Result Page

## Issue Description
The Audio Generated Successfully view (result.html template) was not displaying the input text that was converted to audio. This created a confusing user experience as users couldn't verify what text was actually processed.

## Root Cause
After investigating the codebase, the root cause was identified as a missing parameter in the URL redirect to the result page. In the `/` route's form submission handler, when redirecting to the `/result` route, the original text content was not being passed as a URL parameter.

Before the fix:
```python
# Redirect to result page
return redirect(url_for('result', 
                       filename=filename, 
                       voice=voice, 
                       model=model, 
                       text_length=len(text),
                       num_chunks=num_chunks,
                       processing_time=f"{processing_time:.2f} seconds"))
```

The `text` parameter was missing from this URL redirection, but the result template was expecting it:
```html
<div class="mb-3">
    <label class="fw-bold"><i class="bi bi-textarea-t me-1"></i> Input Text</label>
    <div class="p-3 border rounded bg-light overflow-auto" style="max-height: 200px;">
        <p class="mb-0">{{ text }}</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added the text parameter to the URL redirect
```python
return redirect(url_for('result', 
                       filename=filename, 
                       voice=voice, 
                       model=model, 
                       text=text,  # Added text parameter
                       text_length=len(text),
                       num_chunks=num_chunks,
                       processing_time=f"{processing_time:.2f} seconds"))
```

### 2. Added session backup for large text
For cases where the text might be too large for URL parameters (which can have size limitations), we added a session-based backup:

```python
# Store the text in session for cases where it's too long for URL
session['last_generated_text'] = text
```

### 3. Added fallback mechanisms in the result route
Enhanced the result route with multiple fallback mechanisms to ensure text is always displayed:

```python
# Try to get text from URL params first, then fallback to session if URL param is empty
text = request.args.get('text', '')
if not text and 'last_generated_text' in session:
    text = session.get('last_generated_text', '')
    # Clear from session after use to save space
    session.pop('last_generated_text', None)

# If still no text, try to get from history
if not text:
    history_data = get_history()
    for item in history_data:
        if item['filename'] == filename:
            text = item['text']
            if text.endswith('...'):  # It's truncated in history
                # Log this issue for monitoring
                app.logger.warning(f"Had to use truncated text from history for {filename}")
            break
```

### 4. Added logging for monitoring
Added error logging to detect if the issue persists despite all the fallback mechanisms:

```python
# Log if text is still empty for debugging
if not text:
    app.logger.error(f"Text is still empty for result page with filename {filename}")
```

## Prevention Measures

To prevent similar issues in the future, the following prevention measures have been implemented:

1. **Layered Data Retrieval**: The system now has multiple layers of data retrieval (URL params → session → history) to ensure critical data is always available.

2. **Logging and Monitoring**: Added logging to detect when fallbacks are used, providing visibility into potential issues.

3. **Explicit Parameter Passing**: Made parameter passing more explicit in URL redirects to prevent omissions.

4. **Session Storage**: Added session storage to handle large text content that might not fit in URL parameters.

## Testing Instructions

To verify this fix:
1. Go to `http://localhost:5001/`
2. Enter some text in the text area
3. Select a voice and model
4. Click "Generate Speech"
5. On the result page, verify that the input text is displayed correctly in the "Input Text" section

## Future Improvements

For further reliability:
1. Consider storing generation data in a database rather than a JSON file
2. Add automated tests specifically for this functionality
3. Add client-side validation and feedback
4. Consider using POST redirects with Flash messages for large data
